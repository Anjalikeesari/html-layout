    <h2>Night view</h2>
    <p>A "nightscape" is a view of a scene at night, or an artistic representation of this. It can refer to a literal nighttime landscape, like a city illuminated by lights or a starry rural scene, or to a depiction of such a scene in a painting, photograph, or other artwork. For photographers, a "nightscape" specifically means a landscape photograph taken at night, often incorporating celestial bodies like the moon and stars.

   <p> Night vision technology allows users to see in low-light or completely dark environments by amplifying available light or detecting heat signatures. It is an essential tool for military, law enforcement, and security operations, as well as for outdoor enthusiasts and professionals working in low-visibility conditions.
